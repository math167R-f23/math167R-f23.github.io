## Learning objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Understand the structures of R objects
2.  Import data from a variety of sources.
3.  Save data in formats that can be used by other programs.
4.  Create publication quality graphs.
5.  Download and install packages.
6.  Create reusable functions.
7.  Perform statistical analysis on R.

## Where to look

**Course website**: Course slides, assignment instructions.

**Canvas**: Official syllabus, submitting assignments, receiving grades, data

## What you need

**Access to a computer with R and RStudio:** the computer lab in MacQuarrie Hall 221 contains computers with all of the software that will be used during the semester.

All of the coursework may be completed on a personal computer and the software is freely available to students.

## Course structure

Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

-   15%: Check-ins

-   30%: Labs

-   15%: Midterm exam

-   20%: Final exam

-   20%: Class project

## Assignments

-   **Check-ins**: On most Mondays, you will be assigned short check-in assignments. These are designed to be completed during lab or shortly after and will be due at the start of the next class. At the end of the quarter, your lowest check-in grade will be dropped. They will be graded on the following two point scale:

    -   0: indicates incomplete or unacceptable work

    -   1: effort towards completing at least 75% of the assignment

    -   2: effort towards completing the entire assignment.

## Assignments

-   **Labs**: On most Wednesdays, you will be assigned Labs. These are extended, more complicated assignments that you will likely not be able to complete during class. They will typically be due the next Wednesday.

## Assignments

-   **Midterm and Final Exams**: There will be one in-person midterm during the semester and one final exam during finals week. Practice questions will be provided in advance of the exams.

-   **Class Project**: During the semester, you will complete a class project that requires you to apply the data manipulation, visualization, and analysis skills covered in this course to a real-world dataset of your choice.

## Late policy

-   **Late Work**: In general, the late policy is as follows: Any assignment that is received late but less than 24 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 25%. Any assignment that is received 24--48 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 50%. Assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours late.

## Collaboration

You may discuss problems, approaches, and solutions with your classmates. Acceptable collaboration is limited to your classmates in this course and you must clearly include on any collaborative work the name(s) of anyone with whom you worked.

All submitted work must be your own; you should not submit code or answers copied from any resource including your classmates. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please ask for clarification.

## ChatGPT (and other tools)...

Students are encouraged to use online resources including large language model-based chatbots (ex. ChatGPT) **as aids for learning and understanding course material**.

However, the use of external resources like ChatGPT to generate code or answers for course assignments, exams, and projects is not permitted.

## Discussion

**Piazza discussion forum**: post questions about assignments and answer questions from other students.

Posts may not include substantial amounts of code that can be used for a solution to any problem, but may include code snippets.

Participation (both questions and answers), **can** earn you up to 2% extra credit for your final grade. Posts will be evaluated based on how substantive and helpful they are to the class.

## Discussion

### Bad questions:

    It returned the following error: \

## Office Hours (aka drop-in hours)

+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In-person   | MH 311 Monday and Wednesday 12:30 to 1:30pm or by appointment (email) |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Zoom        | By appointment                                                        |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Come by:

-   for a snack
-   to ask questions or work with other students
-   just to chat!

**My advice:** make it a habit to drop by office hours, starting early in the semester when schedules are less busy.

## Slides explained

Slides will usually be posted on the course website before class. I encourage you to return to the slides after class and make sure you understand the code used and the concepts covered.

# Introduction to R

## What is R?

![](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png){.absolute top="5px" right="5px" width="11%"}

R is a programming language designed for statistical analysis.

-   open-source

-   free

-   large and active community of developers and users

-   great analysis tools

-   great visualization tools

## Why R?

In this class we will cover programming through the use of the R language, emphasizing **statistical computing** skills.

Advances in computation have enabled advances at every step of the data analysis pipeline:

-   Data collection, storage, and sharing
-   Exploratory data analysis and visualization
-   Statistical inference and prediction
-   Communication and distribution of results

R is a programming language tailored to these tasks.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed to make your life easier.

-   Organizes scripts, files, plots, code console, \...

-   Highlights syntax

-   Helpful interactive graphical interface

-   Will make an efficient, reproducible workflow *much* easier

## A tour through R and RStudio

By default...

* *Top left*: Editor pane. Browse and edit scripts and data with tabs
* *Top right*: List of objects in your Environment (recall `ls()`), code History
* *Bottom left*: Console for running R code line-by-line (`>` prompt)
* *Bottom right*: Files, plots, packages, help files


## RStudio + R: A fancy calculator

```{r, echo = T}
# Addition
6 + 3
```

. . .

```{r, echo = T}
# Subtraction
6 - 3
```

. . .

```{r, echo = T}
# Multiplication
6 * 3
```

. . .

```{r, echo = T}
# Division
6 / 3
```

Here, the `[1]` indicates the first output value. We only have one output value here, but in the future we will have more.

## RStudio + R: A fancy calculator

```{r, echo = T}
# Exponentiation
3 ^ 20
```

R can usually handle bigger numbers than your handheld calculator, but even R has limits:

. . .

```{r, echo = T}
# Bigger exponentiation
3 ^ 1000
```
## Assignment

R can also store values (like numbers) as **objects**, which can be referenced later:

```{r, echo = T}
x <- 7
x
y <- 3
x + y
```

## More than a fancy calculator

Of course, we wouldn't have a whole course on R if this was all it could do.

## Data analysis

```{r, echo = T}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)
```

## Visualization

```{r, echo = T, warning = F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Communication

R Markdown files (see examples [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html))

* Combine code, output, and writing
* Self-contained analyses
* Creates HTML, PDF, slides (like these!), webpages, ...

## Installing R and RStudio

1. Download and install R from [this link](https://cran.rstudio.com)

2. Download and install RStudio Desktop from [this link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Your first check-in

1. On the computer you are using, create a new folder titled "MATH167R" or something similar.

2. Within this folder, create a sub-folder named "checkins" or something similar.

3. Download "01_first-R-code.R" and save it in your checkins folder.

4. Open "01_first-R-code.R" in RStudio. It should look something like the code below.

## Running your first R code

5. Run the code line by line and answer the two questions on the Check-in 1 assignment on Canvas.
