## Programming for data science

In the first half of the semester, we covered skills for exploratory data analysis: visualization and descriptive statistics.

Today, we'll combine those skills with programming concepts.

## Motivating example

Each week,

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::knit_exit()
```

## Functional programming

## Updating results for new data

## Looping through many data files

## Web scraping
