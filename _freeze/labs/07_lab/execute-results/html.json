Skewness and Kurtosis\n\nSkewness describes how asymmetrical the distribution of a numerical variable is around its mean. Given observations $x_1,\\ldots, x_n$, we can calculate the sample skewness $s$ of a variable using the following formula:\n\n$$s = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\overline{x})^3}{\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\overline{x})^2\\right]^{3/2}}$$\nKurtosis is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the distribution of a numerical variable is around its mean. Higher values of kurtosis indicate more extreme outliers. Given observations $x_1,\\ldots, x_n$, we can calculate the sample kurtosis $k$ of a variable using the following formula:\n\n$$k = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\overline{x})^4}{\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\overline{x})^2\\right]^{2}}-3$$\n\n1. Write a function `skewness()` that takes as input a numeric vector `x` and returns the sample skewness. There are functions in R that compute skewness, but you cannot use any of them--write your own implementation.\n\n2. Write a function `kurtosis()` that takes as input a numeric vector `x` and returns the sample skewness. There are functions in R that compute kurtosis, but you cannot use any of them--write your own implementation.\n\n3. Use your function to compute the sample skewness of the `arr_delay` variable in the `flights` dataset contained in the `nycflights13` package.\n\n4. Use your function to compute the sample kurtosis of the `arr_delay` variable in the `flights` dataset contained in the `nycflights13` package.\n\n## B. Writing a simulation function\n\nIn this part, you will simulate a one-dimensional random walk. Suppose you are at the point $x$ at time $t$. At time $t+1$, you have a 50% chance of moving forwards to $x+1$ and a 50% chance of moving backwards to $x-1$. Assume that at time $t=0$, you are at $x_0=0$.\n\n5. Write a function `random_walk()` that takes as input a single numeric $n$ and simulates $n$ steps of a one-dimensional random walk. The output should be a length vector of length $n+1$ starting with 0 where the $(i+1)$th entry represents the location of the random walker at time $t=i$. For example, `random_walk(5)` may return the vector $(0, 1, 2, 1, 2)$.\n\n6. Use your function to generate a random walk of 100 steps and generate a line graph with $t=0,1,\\ldots, 100$ on the x-axis and $x_0,\\ldots, x_{100}$ on the y-axis.",
